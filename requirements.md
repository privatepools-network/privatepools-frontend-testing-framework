Project Overview
This document outlines the requirements for improving the codebase and structure of the Vue.js project to enhance maintainability, scalability, and performance.

Codebase Organization

- Restructure the project directories to separate components, views, store, services, and assets.
- Establish a consistent naming convention for files and folders.

Code Quality

- Integrate ESLint with Vue-specific rules.
- Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.
- Implement TypeScript for static type checking. (optional)

State Management

- Use Pinia for state management with a modular structure.
- Ensure state logic is centralized and easily testable.

Component Design

- Develop reusable components for common UI elements.
- Utilize the Composition API for better logic reuse.
- Define clear interfaces for props and events.

Routing

- Implement Vue Router with dynamic and lazy-loaded routes.
- Ensure routes are well-organized and documented.

Styling

- Integrate a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.
- Use scoped styles to prevent global style conflicts.

Testing

- Write unit tests for components using Jest.
- Implement end-to-end tests with Cypress.

Build and Deployment

- Optimize Webpack/Vite configuration for production.
- Use environment variables for configuration management.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

Documentation
Maintain clear code comments and update the README.
Document APIs and component interfaces thoroughly.

Performance
Optimize component rendering and state management.
Implement code splitting to reduce initial load time.
